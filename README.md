Overview

This project is a medical chatbot that provides answers based on information extracted from medical books and PDFs. The chatbot utilizes LangChain, FAISS, and HuggingFace's Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 to create a question-answering system with context-aware retrieval.

Features

PDF Document Ingestion: Loads and processes PDFs to extract relevant text.

Chunking and Embeddings: Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to split text and HuggingFaceEmbeddings to generate vector embeddings.

FAISS Vector Store: Stores document embeddings for efficient retrieval.

Mistral-7B-Instruct LLM: Uses HuggingFace's Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 for generating responses.

Custom Prompting: Ensures chatbot responses are strictly based on the provided documents.

Streamlit UI: Provides a user-friendly chat interface.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Usage

Step 1: Load and Process PDFs

Place your medical PDFs in the data/ directory.

Run the script to process the documents and store embeddings:

python process_pdfs.py

Step 2: Run the Chatbot

streamlit run chatbot.py

Configuration

Set your HuggingFace API token 

HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
